### 2024

#### Aug 19 - 23

Main goals
1) Breakdown of error discrepancy
   * Data variance, parameterization style (gauss-leg, uniform, arc), model invariance
   * TODO:
     1) Old training, old geometry, old data gen, G-L - RMSE = 
     2) Old training, old geometry, new data gen, G-L - RMSE = 
     3) Old training, old geometry, new data gen, Uni - RMSE = 
     4) Old training, old geometry, new data gen, Arc - RMSE = 
     5) Old training, new geometry, new data gen, G-L - RMSE = 
     6) Old training, new geometry, new data gen, Uni - RMSE = 
     7) New training, new geometry, new data gen, G-L - RMSE = 
     8) New training, new geometry, new data gen, Arc - RMSE = 
    a vs b shows high variance data, b vs c vs d shows parameterization, b vs e shows new geometry,  
2) Second draft
   1) Figures are done 
   2) 
3) New direction

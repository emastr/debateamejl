* [Thesis from KTH Mechanics](), discusses Non homogeneous but not variable coefficients. Erik Bostr√∂m, thesis. BC for Spec sim of atm. Bound layers
* Spectral element methods: recent dev. applications, perspectives.
* Pip suggested articles: [Imposing D-N-R condition in level-set](), constant $\alpha$.[Stress-free bc over deformed bathymetry]() seems more like what we want.
